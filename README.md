### **Context**

Telecommunications refer to the transmission of information through electronic means such as telephony, television, radio, and more recently, the internet. These means of communication enable the transmission of information between people, organizations, and devices over long distances.

The internet, on the other hand, is a global network of interconnected computers that allows for real-time information exchange. Since its inception, it has had a significant impact on people's lives, transforming the way we communicate, work, learn, and entertain ourselves.

The telecommunications industry has played a vital role in our society, facilitating information exchange at an international scale and enabling continuous communication even amidst a global pandemic. Data transfer and communication are mostly carried out through the internet, fixed telephone lines, mobile telephony, and almost anywhere in the world.

Compared to the global average, Argentina is at the forefront of telecommunications development, with a total of [62.12 million connections] as of 2020 (https://www.datosmundial.com/america/argentina/telecomunicacion.php).
